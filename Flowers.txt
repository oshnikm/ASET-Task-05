Flowers are one of life's simplest pleasures, representing beauty in its purest, most flawless form.
There's nothing like a vase of flowers to add a pop of color to your living room, the myriad of colors in a field of wildflowers, or the scent of a fragrant bouquet. 
People even travel far distances to witness seasonal blooms, 
like the cherry blossoms in Japan or the tulips in The Netherlands.
